抑制托卡马克等离子体径向输运对改善约束、增大能量约束时间至关重要。测地声模通过对湍流径向结构施加速度剪切作用，能够改善输运，因此受到广泛关注。实验中观察到的测地声模包括两种形式。一种是局域在某个小半径位置处，称为局域模式，其频谱在径向上连续分布。另一种是在有限的径向区域内存在，称为测地声本征模，在这种情况下，局域的测地声模连续谱对应分解为一个或多个频率平台的径向拓展的“阶梯”结构。测地声本征模的模式结构可由动理学或磁流体模型求解得到，目前对其研究大都局限在理想情形，对其形成过程和非理想效应下的影响尚未完全阐明。托卡马克中等离子体存在内禀转动，和外部辅助加热驱动的转动，如中性束注入、离子回旋共振加热等，是典型的非理想效应。在强转动状态下，局域的测地声模频率会发生上移，造成共振粒子数减少以减小阻尼，但环向转动对测地声本征模的影响尚未给出明确结论。本文在动理学模型下，考虑离子热速度量级的环向转动，求解得到测地声本征模，对其频谱、模结构特点加以研究。为了探究环向转动对测地声本征模的影响，对比了不同马赫数下的本征结构。结果表明，本征模式与连续谱的行为强相关，因为本征模频率在其振幅最大值处与连续谱频率相匹配。具体来说，随着环向转动马赫数的增加，本征频率也随之增加，和连续谱表现出相同的特性。对于模结构方面，由于连续谱的斜率在边缘处随着马赫数增加而增大，导致共振激发本征模的位置外移，使边缘的本征模结构向外“挤压”。


Suppressing radial transport in tokamak plasmas is crucial for improving confinement and extending energy confinement time. Geodesic acoustic modes (GAMs) effectively enhance transport by imposing velocity shear on turbulent radial structures, thus attracting significant attention. Experimentally observed GAMs manifest in two forms: **local modes**, which are localized at a small radial position with a continuous radial spectrum; and **geodesic acoustic eigenmodes (GAEMs)**, which exist within a finite radial region. In the latter case, the continuous spectrum of local GAMs decomposes into radially extended "ladder" structures comprising one or more frequency platforms.

The mode structure of GAEMs can be obtained by solving kinetic or magnetohydrodynamic models. However, current research is largely confined to ideal conditions, and their formation mechanisms and the influence of non-ideal effects remain to be fully elucidated. Tokamak plasmas exhibit intrinsic rotation, as well as rotation driven by external auxiliary heating (e.g., neutral beam injection, ion cyclotron resonance heating), all of which are typical non-ideal effects. Under strong rotation, the frequency of local GAMs shifts upward, reducing the number of resonant particles and thereby decreasing damping. Yet, the impact of toroidal rotation on GAEMs has not been conclusively determined.

This paper, employing a kinetic model, investigates GAEMs by considering toroidal rotation on the order of ion thermal velocity. We solve for GAEMs and study their spectrum and mode structure characteristics. To explore the influence of toroidal rotation on GAEMs, we compare the eigenstructures at different Mach numbers.

Results indicate a strong correlation between the behavior of eigenmodes and the continuous spectrum, as the eigenmode frequency matches the continuous spectrum frequency at the peak of the eigenmode amplitude. Specifically, as the toroidal rotation Mach number increases, the eigenfrequency also rises, exhibiting the same characteristics as the continuous spectrum. Regarding the mode structure, because the slope of the continuous spectrum at the edge increases with the Mach number, the position where resonant excitation of eigenmodes occurs shifts outward, causing the edge eigenmode structure to be "compressed" outward.
