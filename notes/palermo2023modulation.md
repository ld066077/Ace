# 标题::Modulation behaviour and possible existence criterion of geodesic acoustic modes in tokamak devices

## 1.Abstract&Info
### 1.1 Abstract
Geodesic acoustic modes (GAMs) represent the oscillating counterpart of zonal flow in tokamak plasma and can affect transport due to their interaction with turbulence eddies. GAMs have been observed in many experiments and modelled under different conditions, but because of their variety of characteristics, we do not yet have a complete picture of their dynamics. It has been demonstrated that optical methods can be efficiently used to describe and predict several characteristics of the GAM radial structures that can be interpreted as ‘waves’ propagating in the space-time. We exploit complex eikonal theories to investigate the behavior of GAMs that are commonly observed in experiments, and find that their periodic modulation and intermittency can be explained by the properties of the equilibrium temperature profile. Theoretical results obtained in this work are supported by gyrokinetic simulations for several equilibria. Implications for existence criteria and GAM dynamics in different plasma equilibrium conditions are discussed, with particular attention to the edge plasma in low and high confinement modes.

>In fact, their frequency typically around 20 kHz in presentday tokamaks is slow enough to radially shear turbulent eddies and reduce the associated cross-field transport. [jump to](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AMCQDX5K?page=2&annotation=D4PSHTPT)

标注：🔤事实上，在当今的托卡马克中，它们的频率通常约为 20 kHz，足够慢，足以径向剪切湍流涡流并减少相关的跨场传输。🔤

GAM intermittency（间歇性）：GAM频谱在时间上表现为连续性，但其幅度收到调制变化，因而观察到类似间歇的行为。
而 平均双谱分析表明，GAM 与宽带湍流的非线性相互作用的强度会随着 GAM 的大小而变化。
