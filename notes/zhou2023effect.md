# 标题::The effect of the diamagnetic drift on geodesic acoustic modes in tokamak plasmas

## 1.Abstract&Info
### 1.1 Abstract
The effect of the radial derivative of the equilibrium particle distribution, i.e., the diamagnetic drift effect, on geodesic acoustic modes is taken into account in this work. The effect was routinely neglected in the previous studies on the geodesic acoustic mode since the dominant mode number is m=n ¼ 0=0. However, for finite electron temperatures, small m 6¼ 0 side bands are present and the diamagnetic drift effect enters through these side bands. In this work, we find that the mode frequencies increase with the particle density gradient. The temperature ratio between electrons and ions, i.e., s ¼ Te=Ti, is a key parameter influencing this effect. The effect is more prominent for higher s values. Another effect is the symmetry breaking of the propagating direction of the sideband potentials. In contrast to the pure standing wave form, the potential perturbation consists of a standing wave superimposed with a small amplitude traveling wave, which is nearly proportional to the density gradient.

>Indeed, for a pure m=n ¼ 0=0perturbation, the radial distribution will not influence the modes, which is obvious from the gyrokinetic equation. If the magnetic effect and finite electron temperature are included, small m 6 ¼ 0 side bands should be self-consistently considered and the radial distribution effect enters.

>Another effect of the diamagnetic drift is the symmetry breaking of the propagating direction of the sideband potentials. Without the diamagnetic drift, the perturbed sideband potentials have a pure standing wave form to the leading order. When the diamagnetic drift effect is taken into account, the potential perturbation consists of a standing wave superimposed with a traveling wave, whose amplitude is nearly proportional to the density gradient.
