# 标题::Axisymmetric Alfvén modes induced by energetic particles in tokamak plasmas

## 1.Abstract&Info
### 1.1 Abstract
Axisymmetric Alfv en modes in the presence of energetic ions are studied using the MHD-kinetic hybrid model for tokamak plasmas. The general dispersion relation of continuous spectra is derived for the coupled m ¼ 0; 62 poloidal harmonics. The dispersion relation is analyzed for the single pitch angle slowing down distribution of well circulating energetic particles. In addition to the conventional axisymmetric Alfv en modes existing in the pure MHD description, axisymmetric Alfv en modes are also induced by the energetic ions if the pressure ratio between the energetic ions and the magnetic energy density is larger than a critical value, and the transit frequency of the energetic ions is in resonance with the emerging Alfv en modes. The existence of global Alfv en eigenmodes is also discussed.

>Although, for the sake of simplicity, the electrostatic model is usually adopted in the theoretical investigation of GAMs, a magnetic component with poloidal number m ¼ 2 exists in GAMs if the finite beta effect is taken into account.19 The magnetic signals were often used as a diagnostic of GAMs in some previous experiments.

>Although it was believed that the frequency of AAWs is too high to have a resonance with EPs under the present tokamak discharge conditions,4 we find that EPs can be in sideband resonance with AAWs so that the particle transit frequency is almost one third of the mode frequency.
