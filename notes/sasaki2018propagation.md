# 标题::Propagation direction of geodesic acoustic modes driven by drift wave turbulence

## 1.Abstract&Info
### 1.1 Abstract
Selection rule of the radial propagation direction of geodesic acoustic modes (GAMs) is investigated. Here, we study the influence of nonlinear coupling with drift wave turbulence on the propagation direction of GAMs. Based on wave-kinetic equation for the turbulence, the phase-space dynamics is numerically solved and the nonlinear saturated states are obtained, where the phase-space consists of the real space and the wavenumber space. A wave pattern of the GAM in a nonlinear saturated state varies to form a standing wave, outward and inward propagating waves, depending on the peak radial wavenumber of the turbulence. The impact of nonlinear coupling with turbulence is discussed by deriving the GAM dispersion relation that includes the effect of the turbulence.
