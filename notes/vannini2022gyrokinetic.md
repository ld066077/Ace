# 标题::Gyrokinetic modelling of the Alfvén mode and EGAM activity in ASDEX Upgrade

## 1.Abstract&Info
### 1.1 Abstract
Energetic particles present in tokamak machines can drive through resonant waveparticle interaction different plasma instabilities, e.g Alfv´en modes and energetic particle-driven geodesic acoustic modes (EGAMs). While the former are potentially detrimental as they can enhance the energetic particle transport and damage the machine wall, the latter are axisymmetric, possibly benign modes that can act to regulate turbulence. A unique scenario, the so-called NLED-AUG case, has been developed in ASDEX Upgrade by tuning the plasma parameters so that the energetic particle kinetic energy is 100 times higher than that of the background plasma, like in ITER. An intense energetic particle-driven activity is observed, most prominently various Alfv´en mode bursts triggering chirping EGAMs. The present work reports studies on the Alfv´en mode and EGAM dynamics showing, for the first time, many toroidal mode gyrokinetic simulations with ORB5 where the NLED-AUG case scenario is considered. We study the mode dynamics modelling the energetic particles with different equilibrium distribution functions, such as: isotropic slowing-down, double-bump-on-tail and equivalent Maxwellian. We retain, at the beginning, the nonlinearities only in the energetic particle dynamics. Later, also the background plasma species nonlinearities are taken into account.

>Only by modelling the EPs with the doublebump-on-tail we observe the perturbation with n = {0}-only to be driven. Consistently with the studies presented in Ref. [21, 18], this perturbation appears to be an EGAM driven unstable because of the anisotropy in velocity-space contained in the double-bump-on-tail.
