# 标题::Collisionless damping of zonal flows in helical systems

## 1.Abstract&Info
### 1.1 Abstract
Collisionless time evolution of zonal flows in helical systems is investigated. An analytical expression describing the collisionless response of the zonal-flow potential to the initial potential and a given turbulence source is derived from the gyrokinetic equations combined with the quasineutrality condition. The dispersion relation for the geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) in helical systems is derived from the short-time response kernel for the zonal-flow potential. It is found that helical ripples in the magnetic-field strength as well as finite orbit widths of passing ions enhance the GAM damping. The radial drift motions of particles trapped in helical ripples cause the residual zonal-flow level in the collisionless long-time limit to be lower for longer radial wavelengths and deeper helical ripples. On the other hand, a high-level zonal-flow response, which is not affected by helical-ripple-trapped particles, can be maintained for a longer time by reducing their radial drift velocity. This implies a possibility that helical configurations optimized for reducing neoclassical ripple transport can simultaneously enhance zonal flows which lower anomalous transport. The validity of our analytical results is verified by gyrokinetic Vlasov simulation.

标注：🔤对于较长的径向波长和较深的螺旋波纹，被捕获在螺旋波纹中的粒子的径向漂移运动导致无碰撞长时间极限中的残余层流水平较低。另一方面，不受螺旋波纹捕获颗粒影响的高水平层流响应可以通过降低其径向漂移速度来维持较长时间。这意味着为减少新古典波纹输运而优化的螺旋结构可以同时增强层流，从而降低异常输运。我们的分析结果的有效性通过回旋Vlasov 模拟得到验证。🔤

螺旋装置中，捕获在螺旋波纹场中粒子的径向漂移运动导致无碰撞长时间极限中的 残余带状流水平降低。同时不受螺旋波纹场影响的高水平带状流在减小径向漂移下会得到增强，以维持较长时间，因此为减少新经典ripple输运（径向输运）的构型改进可以同时增强带状流以降低反常输运。
