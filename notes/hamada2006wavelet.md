# 标题::Wavelet and Fourier analysis of zonal flows and density fluctuations in JIPP T-llU tokamak plasmas

## 1.Abstract&Info
### 1.1 Abstract
Wavelet and two-dimensional Fourier analyses of local potential and density signals were conducted. These signals were obtained in the core region of tokamak plasmas by a multiple-sample-volume heavy ion beam probe. In the low-density Ohmic plasma where the electron temperature is much higher than that of the ions, the high-frequency (HF) zonal flow in geodesic acoustic mode frequency region is more energetic than the low-frequency zonal flow from 10 to 1000 Hz in terms of integrated intensity. This result is in sharp contrast to the results of ITG simulations of the tokamak plasmas. The HF zonal flow has a short lifetime (a few cycles). The wavelet spectra of density are much more chaotic than those of potential turbulence, changing the amplitude and frequency of the dominant modes more rapidly within the lifetime of the HF zonal flows. It was also found that HF parts of the density fluctuations are highly modulated by the HF zonal flows.

>Wavelet analysis shows that density tends to oscillate like a burst at one or two frequencies and the duration of the burst tends to be less than a hundred microseconds in most cases. The average lifetime of GAM zonal flow may not be determined by the lifetime of the local density fluctuations. [jump to](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XTNZKHBQ?page=15&annotation=FR23VE3L)

标注：🔤小波分析表明，密度往往会在一两个频率下像爆发一样振荡，并且爆发的持续时间在大多数情况下往往小于一百微秒。 GAM 纬向流的平均寿命可能不是由局部密度波动的寿命决定的。🔤

>The density fluctuations higher than 100 kHz may be modulated by the zonal flow at the GAM frequency region. [jump to](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XTNZKHBQ?page=15&annotation=XUIU46KZ)

标注：🔤高于 100 kHz 的密度波动可以通过 GAM 频率区域的纬向流进行调制。🔤
