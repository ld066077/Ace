# 标题::Global geodesic acoustic mode in a tokamak with positive magnetic shear and a monotonic temperature profile

## 1.Abstract&Info
### 1.1 Abstract
The analytical solution for global geodesic acoustic modes (GGAMs) in a tokamak with a positive magnetic shear proﬁle and a monotonic temperature proﬁle is found in the framework of magnetohydrodynamic theory. The axisymmetric eigenvalue problem for perturbed pressure and electrostatic potential is formulated as a recurrent set of equations for poloidal Fourier harmonics. The integral condition for the existence of GGAMs is obtained. It is shown that the traditional paradigm of having a off-axis maximum of the local geodesic acoustic frequency is not necessary for the existence of GGAMs; a representative example is designed.
