口语模板
**people**
I'd like to talk about **Amina**, a **Uyghur student from Xinjiang** whom I met at university. We first connected in a project group, and we quickly became friends because we shared the same curiosity about languages and travel.
What strikes me about her is that she is **genuinely intelligent** and **energetic**. She doesn't just get high grades—she has a knack for breaking down complex ideas and explaining them in plain English. Outside class, she runs three times a week and volunteers at weekend community events, which says a lot about her discipline.
One moment that really stayed with me was when she **persuaded me to join a public-speaking club**. I used to avoid speaking in front of people, but she coached me through my first talk, even rehearsed with me after dinner. Thanks to her push, I delivered a short speech and felt surprisingly confident.
Another fun detail is her **sense of style**—mostly minimalist outfits with one eye-catching accessory. It's simple yet memorable, and it matches her professional attitude.
Overall, I enjoy spending time with her because I always learn something—about Uyghur culture, study skills, or just how to manage time better. If anything, she has inspired me to be braver and more proactive, and that influence still shapes my choices today.
我想谈谈**阿米娜**，她是一位来自**新疆的维吾尔族学生**，我在大学时认识她。我们最初在一个项目小组里结识，因为都对语言和旅行充满好奇，很快就成了朋友。
最让我印象深刻的是，她既**聪明**又**充满活力**。她不只是成绩好——还很擅长把复杂的概念拆解开来，用浅显的英语解释清楚。课外她每周跑步三次，周末会在社区活动中做志愿者，这充分体现了她的自律。
有一个让我记忆犹新的时刻是，她**说服我加入演讲俱乐部**。我过去总是回避在人前讲话，但她一路指导我完成第一次演讲，甚至在晚饭后还陪我排练。多亏她的推动，我做了一次简短的演讲，而且出乎意料地自信。
另一个有趣的细节是她的**穿搭品味**——大多是极简风格，配上一件醒目的配饰。简单却令人难忘，也与她专业、干练的态度十分契合。
总的来说，我喜欢和她在一起，因为我总能学到东西——关于维吾尔族文化、学习技巧，或者如何更好地管理时间。说到底，她激励我变得更勇敢、更主动，而这种影响直到今天仍在塑造我的选择。

**event**
**Event**: I would like to talk about an event I attended last year, which was a **charity concert organized by a local nonprofit**.
**Details of the Event**: The event was held at a popular auditorium in my city, and it was organized by a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting cancer research. The purpose of this concert was to raise funds for cancer awareness and provide financial assistance to those undergoing treatment. During the event, I volunteered to help with various tasks, such as setting up the venue, guiding the attendees to their seats, and assisting the performers backstage.
**Why the Event was Memorable**: What made this event particularly special for me was the combination of music and charity. The concert featured local artists, each donating their time and talents to the cause. There was a genuine sense of community, with people from all walks of life coming together to support a shared goal. The performances were not only talented but deeply emotional, with some songs dedicated to those fighting cancer. The way the audience connected with the cause was incredibly moving.
**How You Felt About It**: Overall, the experience was uplifting and inspiring. I felt proud to be part of something so meaningful and impactful. It was heartwarming to witness the generosity of the people and the incredible support for the cause. I also felt a sense of fulfillment knowing that my small contribution as a volunteer helped make the event run smoothly. The experience reminded me of the power of music to unite people for a noble cause and reinforced my desire to be more involved in charitable activities in the future.
**活动**：我想谈谈我去年参加的一次活动，那就是由一个本地非营利组织举办的**慈善音乐会**。
**活动详情**：这个活动在我所在城市的一个著名剧院举行，由一个致力于支持癌症研究的非营利组织组织。音乐会的目的是筹集资金，提高癌症意识，并为正在接受治疗的患者提供经济援助。在活动期间，我作为志愿者参与了多个任务，如布置场地、引导观众入座以及在后台协助表演者。
**为什么这个活动令人难忘**：这次活动之所以特别，主要是因为它将音乐和慈善结合在了一起。音乐会邀请了本地的艺术家，每个人都为这个事业捐赠了自己的时间和才华。活动中，来自各行各业的人们共同聚集在一起，支持一个共同的目标，现场充满了真正的社区感。表演不仅技艺高超，而且情感丰富，一些歌曲是献给那些与癌症斗争的人们的。观众与这个事业的联系也让我深受感动。
**你的感受**：总体来说，这次经历让我感到振奋和启发。我为自己能参与这样有意义且有影响力的活动感到自豪。看到人们的慷慨和对这一事业的巨大支持，让我感到十分温暖。我也感到一种成就感，因为我作为志愿者的小小贡献，帮助活动顺利进行。这次经历让我再次感受到音乐的力量，它能够将人们团结在一起为崇高的事业奋斗，也让我更加坚定了参与慈善活动的决心。

**object**
**Object**: I would like to talk about a toy that my parents bought for me when I was a child. It's a **traditional Chinese spinning top**, also known as "陀螺" (tuó luó).
**Description**: The spinning top is made of wood and painted with bright colors, including red, green, and yellow. It has a small metal spike at the bottom that you use to spin it. It’s relatively small, fitting comfortably in the palm of my hand. The design is simple yet charming, and it has a smooth finish, which makes it easy to spin.
**Why it's Special**: This toy is particularly special to me because it’s deeply tied to Chinese culture and my childhood memories. My parents bought it for me when I was about five years old. I remember spending countless hours with it, trying to get it to spin as fast as possible, and competing with my friends to see whose top could spin the longest. It’s more than just a toy to me; it represents the traditional games I played with family and friends, and it reminds me of my childhood in China.
**How You Feel About It**: Whenever I see this spinning top, I feel a sense of nostalgia and happiness. It brings back fond memories of simpler times when I could spend hours just playing with a toy and enjoying the moment. I feel a strong connection to my culture and my childhood, and it’s a reminder of how much my parents cared to give me something so meaningful and traditional.
I keep it in a special place at home, and whenever I look at it, I feel a warm sense of connection to my past. Even though I don’t play with it anymore, I will keep it as a family treasure, hoping to pass it down to future generations to remind them of our cultural heritage.
**物品**：我想谈谈一个我小时候父母买给我的玩具，它是一个**传统的中国陀螺**，也叫“陀螺”（tuó luó）。
**描述**：这个陀螺是用木头做的，涂上了鲜艳的颜色，包括红色、绿色和黄色。它的底部有一个小金属尖，可以用来转动它。它相对较小，能够舒适地放在我的手掌里。设计简单却很迷人，表面光滑，这使得它很容易旋转。
**为什么它特别**：这个玩具对我来说特别，因为它深深与中国文化和我的童年记忆相连。大约在我五岁的时候，父母给我买了它。我记得我曾经花了无数的时间，努力让它转得尽可能快，还和朋友们比赛，看看谁的陀螺能转得最久。它对我来说不仅仅是一个玩具；它代表了我和家人、朋友一起玩传统游戏的时光，也让我想起了在中国的童年。
**我的感受**：每次看到这个陀螺，我都会感到一股怀旧和幸福的情感。它让我回忆起那些简单的时光，那时候我可以花几个小时只玩一个玩具，享受当下。我感觉自己和我的文化、我的童年有了强烈的联系，这也是我父母对我深深关爱的体现，他们给了我这样一个有意义且传统的礼物。
我把它放在家里的一个特别地方，每次看到它，我都会感到一种温暖的联系，仿佛回到了过去。尽管现在我已经不再玩它，但我会将它作为家族的珍宝保留下来，希望能传给下一代，让他们也能记住我们的文化遗产。








 Do you like where you live?
 no, not really. i don't quite like the public transportation there. i mean, there'sno subway stations near my home, and the nearest bus stop is about 20 minuteswalk away, which is really inconvenient.

ls there anything you dislike about your hometown?
yeah, i think so. i don't like the high housing prices here. i mean, for example.if you want to buy a condo/an apartment in the center of the city, it costs at least 10 million RMB, which is crazy. it's about 1.5 million US dollars. And it's just about 100 square meters in size.

Is it easy to learn music?
no, definitely not. i believe it's extremely hard to learn music, whether it's singing or playing a musical instrument. Personally, l used to learn to play the piano for five years in primary school, but even when i was 12, when i had graduated from primary school, i was still far from good at it.
