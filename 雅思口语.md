口语模板
**people**
I'd like to talk about **Amina**, a **Uyghur student from Xinjiang** whom I met at university. We first connected in a project group, and we quickly became friends because we shared the same curiosity about languages and travel.
What strikes me about her is that she is **genuinely intelligent** and **energetic**. She doesn't just get high grades—she has a knack for breaking down complex ideas and explaining them in plain English. Outside class, she runs three times a week and volunteers at weekend community events, which says a lot about her discipline.
One moment that really stayed with me was when she **persuaded me to join a public-speaking club**. I used to avoid speaking in front of people, but she coached me through my first talk, even rehearsed with me after dinner. Thanks to her push, I delivered a short speech and felt surprisingly confident.
Another fun detail is her **sense of style**—mostly minimalist outfits with one eye-catching accessory. It's simple yet memorable, and it matches her professional attitude.
Overall, I enjoy spending time with her because I always learn something—about Uyghur culture, study skills, or just how to manage time better. If anything, she has inspired me to be braver and more proactive, and that influence still shapes my choices today.
我想谈谈**阿米娜**，她是一位来自**新疆的维吾尔族学生**，我在大学时认识她。我们最初在一个项目小组里结识，因为都对语言和旅行充满好奇，很快就成了朋友。
最让我印象深刻的是，她既**聪明**又**充满活力**。她不只是成绩好——还很擅长把复杂的概念拆解开来，用浅显的英语解释清楚。课外她每周跑步三次，周末会在社区活动中做志愿者，这充分体现了她的自律。
有一个让我记忆犹新的时刻是，她**说服我加入演讲俱乐部**。我过去总是回避在人前讲话，但她一路指导我完成第一次演讲，甚至在晚饭后还陪我排练。多亏她的推动，我做了一次简短的演讲，而且出乎意料地自信。
另一个有趣的细节是她的**穿搭品味**——大多是极简风格，配上一件醒目的配饰。简单却令人难忘，也与她专业、干练的态度十分契合。
总的来说，我喜欢和她在一起，因为我总能学到东西——关于维吾尔族文化、学习技巧，或者如何更好地管理时间。说到底，她激励我变得更勇敢、更主动，而这种影响直到今天仍在塑造我的选择。




 Do you like where you live?
 no, not really. i don't quite like the public transportation there. i mean, there'sno subway stations near my home, and the nearest bus stop is about 20 minuteswalk away, which is really inconvenient.

ls there anything you dislike about your hometown?
yeah, i think so. i don't like the high housing prices here. i mean, for example.if you want to buy a condo/an apartment in the center of the city, it costs at least 10 million RMB, which is crazy. it's about 1.5 million US dollars. And it's just about 100 square meters in size.

Is it easy to learn music?
no, definitely not. i believe it's extremely hard to learn music, whether it's singing or playing a musical instrument. Personally, l used to learn to play the piano for five years in primary school, but even when i was 12, when i had graduated from primary school, i was still far from good at it.
